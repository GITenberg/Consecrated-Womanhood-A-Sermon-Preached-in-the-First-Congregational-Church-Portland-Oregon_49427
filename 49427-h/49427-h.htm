<span class="first-word">To</span> those who have long lamented the
prevailing tendency in Christian
churches to deny to women the honors
and responsibilities of sacred offices and
duties, such a sermon as "Consecrated Womanhood,"
written by an American clergyman
is like a breadth of fresh air in Neapolitan
church-buildings that have never known
the beauty of sunlight, and the atmospheres
of which have grown heavy through the centuries
with the oppressive weight of suffocating
incense.</p>

<p>The preacher opens his discourse with the
statement that "the Bible honored woman
when every other book was blind to the true
dignity of her character." Scholars differ,
and little is certain when we go back far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
enough in the ancient writings of our race.
But I think there can be no doubt that in all
the earliest literatures of which we have
knowledge, the thought of the world was
more favorable to the development of womanly
independence, than in later compositions,
especially such as have come from
patristic and monastic sources. Certainly we
find the great Greek tragedians unfolding
their noblest ideals in the character of an
Alcestis, and expressing through the lips of an
Antigone their loftiest conceptions of virtue,
and their purest and bravest ethical teachings.
The Jews did not stand alone, as this eloquent
sermon clearly shows, in honoring
woman; but the Old Testament is devoid,
as its most careless reader cannot but see, of
all that wretched admiration for feminine
feebleness of mind and body which seems to
have sprung from masculine vanity, and has
been fostered by centuries of priestly instruction
and popular superstition. As the most
illustrious Jewess now living, Lady Battersea,
wrote in her admirable book some years
ago, when she was Miss Constance de Rothschild,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
"The ideal woman of the ancient Israelite
was always strong and fearless—a Miriam,
a Deborah, a Judith, an Esther. Not a word
in that older Bible denies to woman the right
to exercise every power of speech or action
granted her by Jehovah."</p>

<p>Nothing assuredly can be more broadminded
or more generous than Dr. Marvin's
whole treatment of the claims of women,
whether in politics, in the religious life, or in
the domestic circle. In my humble opinion
it would do infinite service in awakening
thought and dispelling prejudice, could the
sermon on "Consecrated Womanhood" be
preached in every church and chapel in England.
The good Quakers alone, so far as I
know, have no need for its admonition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the
distaff. She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth
out her hands to the needy. Strength and honor are her clothing;
and she shall rejoice in time to come. She openeth her mouth with
wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness."—<i>Proverbs.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcap_it.jpg" width="88" height="81" alt="It" />
<span class="first-word">It</span> is the peculiarity of the Bible that it
honored woman when every other
book was blind to the true dignity of
her character and the royal possibilities of her
nature. The old Testament exalted her not
only as wife and mother, but as citizen and
ruler, and some of the most stirring songs and
daring deeds of patriotism are recorded in the
Bible to the honor of woman. Her inspired
pen is immortalized in the Word of God, and
if it be not meet that her voice sound from
the halls of Congress, it is a fact of history
that it was heard on the field of battle and in
the chamber of justice more than three thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
years ago, when, by the mouth of Deborah
and the hand of Jael, the Lord delivered
Israel from the power of the spoiler.
She may not be thought competent to have
part in framing the laws of a State, but she
was competent to judge the chosen people and
to mould the character of the world's Redeemer.</p>

<p>The conservative who would obstruct the
wheels of progress endeavors to accomplish
his end by an appeal to the Bible. Sacred
Scriptures were represented as the friend of
slavery; they are now cited in defense of
Papal idolatry and Mormon impurity; and
how often we hear them quoted against the
emancipation of woman. But the Bible is the
most radical book in all the world, and its
maxims of wisdom and virtue are in advance
of every age. Whatever has been accomplished
for the improvement of woman's lot
may be traced to its hallowed influence. "It
found her the slave of man's appetite in the
East, the servant of his cupidity in the West,
and the victim of his cruelty in the South,"
and it broke the chain that bound her soul in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
darkness and the social fetters that linked her
womanhood with dishonor.</p>

<p>We have in the Bible pictures of womanly
tenderness and nobleness, and also of womanly
debasement unequaled in secular literature. I
know how exalted are the women of Homer—"The
Heroes' Battle-Prize," "The Heavenly-Minded,"
"The Sought-For," "The
Sister of Heroes," "The Widely-Praised,"
"Ruling by Beauty," "The Far-Thoughted,"
"The Hospitable," "The Ship-Guider,"
and "The Web-Raveler"—names that indicate
the queenly beauty of the women who
bore them; but I search Iliad and Odyssey
in vain for one trace of that glorified character,
sublime self-sacrifice and unwavering
faith which "crowned the daughters of Israel
and made them daughters of Jehovah." On
the other hand, Shakspeare's "Lady Macbeth"
is weakness itself when compared with
Jezebel, who from the harem of Ahab
mounted with blood-stained feet the throne
of God's chosen people, and there defied the
majesty of heaven. How cold, cruel, implacable
and lost to all that is human was that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
accursed daughter of murder, whose crimes
were far greater in number and turpitude
than those of her infamous father Ethbaal.
We hear from her lips no cry,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line"><span class="indent5">"Come, you spirits</span></div>
    <div class="line">That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here;</div>
    <div class="line">And fill me, from crown to the toe, top-full</div>
    <div class="line">Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood,</div>
    <div class="line">Stop up the access and passage to remorse</div>
    <div class="line">That no compunctious visitings of nature</div>
    <div class="line">Shake my fell purpose!"</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Her entire nature was not only unsexed, but
dehumanized. In her "woman's breasts"
the milk was turned to gall.</p>

<p>Lord Lytton, the elegant and shallow
trifler, tells us, "A woman's noblest station
is retreat," but "retreat" is a word forever unpopular
with the women of the Bible. Miriam,
Huldah, Deborah and Anna were not
of Lord Lytton's opinion. They joined in
one temperament silk and steel, and added to
the sweetness of womanhood the strength of
manhood. Keen and flexible as the Damascus
blade, they were not wanting in the gentleness
and modesty which are a woman's crown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of honor. I open Exodus and read a song
from Miriam, the prophetess, that is older
than the most ancient pagan lyric, and that
will continue when English literature is forgotten.
And there is Deborah, the nurse of
Rebecca; how tenderly the Bible records
her humble but faithful service. In ancient
times and in the East nurses were held in
greater esteem than now with us. Homer
sang their praise; Virgil celebrated their virtues;
and Ovid extolled their wisdom and
kindness. It is no trivial office to guide and
direct the development of a child's life. The
nurse is second mother, and her influence is
sometimes, perhaps often, deathless as the
soul she instructs. The Bible teaches respect
and consideration for those who are socially
beneath us as servants, nurses, and dependent
children of humble toil. The true lady takes
her politeness into the kitchen; it is her ability
to do so that makes her the lady she is.
Not fine manners in the ball-room, but a genuine
and gracious dignity seasoned with womanly
kindness, creates the true lady. Few
think of the Bible as a book of social and domestic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
etiquette, and yet such it is. Let a man
follow its precepts, and he shall become not
only a good man, but a <i>gentleman</i>; and whatever
woman will conform to the spirit of the
Sermon on the Mount shall find her life
steadily developing into all that makes a
beautiful character and fine address.</p>

<p>And there is the other Deborah, a prophetess
and judge in Israel—the woman divinely
illuminated. I turn to the fifth chapter of
Judges, and read a song she wrote long before
the gods of Greece held sacred counsel
upon snowy Olympus—centuries before the
lyric muse took up her abode beneath the
shadow of the Parthenon. To what glorious
victory she led the hosts of the Lord
when the enemies of Israel perished among
the "oaks of the wanderers."</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">"After the days of Shamgar, son of Anath,</div>
    <div class="line">After the Helper's days,</div>
    <div class="line">The highways were deserted,</div>
    <div class="line">The traveler went in winding ways.</div>
    <div class="line">Deserted were Israel's hamlets, deserted,</div>
    <div class="line">Till I Deborah rose up—rose up a mother in Israel."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>What a lovely poem is that of Ruth, and
who does not linger with delight over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
story of Esther, so royal and so simple, so
queenly and so modest?</p>

<p>Turn to the New Testament and see how
honored is Mary, the mother of Jesus. Hear
the angelic salutation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span class="small">Hail, thou art highly favored, the Lord is with thee.
  Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God. And
  behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a
  son, and shalt call his name <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>. He shall be great, and
  shall be called the Son of the Most High: and the Lord
  God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: and
  he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever: and of his
  kingdom there shall be no end. (Luke i:28, 30-33, Revised
  Version.)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it surprising that the name "Mary" is
the most popular in all the world, and that
nearly a third of the women of France bear it
in one form or another? What noble service
was rendered to the early churches by
the four daughters of Philip the Evangelist,
Priscilla who instructed Apollos, Phœbe,
Persis, Tryphosa and Tryphena.</p>

<p>The opinion prevails that Providence intended
woman to occupy a place of humble
dependence; that she is inferior in the composition
of her mind and fragile in physical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
constitution; that she is called of God to lead
a life of entire self-abnegation; that she was
created as an everlasting sacrifice to man's
pleasure and ambition; and that it is her peculiar
mission to be wife and mother to an
extent to which it is not man's mission to be
husband and father. Lord Lytton's dictum
is widely received—"A woman's noblest station
is retreat." It prevails in the State,
robbing her of civil rights, debarring her
from the exercise of popular suffrage, and
closing against her the door of public office.
It permeates society, circumscribing her influence,
dispossessing her of individuality,
and preventing her from the full and free exercise
of whatever taste, talent or genius God
has given her. It is in the church, forbidding
her to enter the pulpit, restraining her
from the important offices of deacon and
trustee, and, in some churches, denying her
even a voice in the ordinary government of
the society.</p>

<p>Men who advocate the subjection of women
plant themselves upon the Bible and
say to us, "You radicals want to turn things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
upside down. You have no respect for the
settled order of society. You would destroy
the divine harmony Heaven has established.
You set aside the teaching of the great Apostle
who said, 'I suffer not a woman to usurp
authority.'" But the Bible is always on the
side of progress. Jesus and his immediate
followers were innovators, agitators and leaders
of public thought and morals. The Jews
quoted the Old Testament against them as
Southern preachers quoted the New Testament
against us when we demanded the abolition
of slavery. We must remember that it
is the mission of the Bible to lead men and not
to follow them. The age that shall overtake
the New Testament will be right in discarding
it. Open the Bible—what does it teach?
"The genuine perfection of humanity, instead
of being the forced obedience of one-half
to the other half, is the spontaneous
obedience of both halves to the law of God.
The incomplete statement of Paul, 'I suffer
not a woman to usurp authority,' is supplemented
by the far deeper words of Jesus,
'Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
it over them, and their great ones exercise
authority over them. Not so shall it be
among you: but whosoever would become
great among you shall be your minister; and
whosoever would be first among you shall be
your servant.' (Matthew xx.:25-27, Revised
Version.) <i>That is the ideal of the future.</i>"
Neither man nor woman shall usurp authority,
but both, in mutual helpfulness, shall
yield willing obedience to the perfect law of
God. A consecrated womanhood is a womanhood
of surrender, not to social prejudices
and superstitions, nor yet to political disability,
but to Heaven. It is a surrender without
defeat and a victory without conquest.
A woman may dance a ballet or sing in an
opera, but the moment she enters the pulpit
to preach a sermon, steps upon a platform to
deliver a lecture, or goes to the polls to vote,
society rises in indignation and disgust. If
a woman may tend as a nurse, why may she
not practice as a physician? If a woman
has a calling to medicine, divinity, law, literature,
art, mechanics, instruction or trade,
what law of God prohibits? But is it wise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
to open our colleges and schools of science
to women? Why not? Are they not capable
of receiving a liberal education? The
part woman has played in ancient and modern
history, in the arts and sciences, as well as in
political life, constitutes not only an answer
to the question, but a positive demand for
admission to every department of knowledge
and industry. Open all the doors and remove
every barrier. Subject girls to the
same requirements you exact of boys in colleges,
but in all justice and fairness set before
them the same rewards. The best educators
tell us that some of the finest mathematical
students are girls. They read Virgil and
Cicero, Xenophon and Homer as well in
every way as do young gentlemen. In mixed
schools you will find, as a general rule, more
girls than boys, and they are found in examination
to carry off the greatest proportion of
prizes. Wherever co-education has been
honestly and competently tried, girls have
shown themselves the intellectual peers of
their brothers. They have more than held
their own. There have been women every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
whit as well educated as the most learned men
of their day, and much better educated than
the majority of men in any age. When Elizabeth
was Queen of England the languages
were an essential element of a lady's education.
The daughters of Sir Anthony Cooke,
to whom was committed the instruction of
the young Edward VI., were thoroughly
trained in both ancient and modern languages,
and in the literatures of many lands and ages.
One of those gifted women wrote Latin verses
of great beauty; another was, according to
Roger Ascham, one of the best Greek scholars
of the age, with the single exception of
Lady Jane Grey; still another was an accomplished
theologian who corresponded in Greek
with Bishop Jewell. The distinguished
Reiske affixed his wife's portrait to his excellent
and famous edition of "The Greek
Orators." And in the preface to that work
he acknowledged his great indebtedness to
her learning and industry. So well acquainted
was she with the language and literature of
ancient Greece, that she shared with her husband
his most profound investigations, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
read for him, correcting as she read, the
proof-sheets of his book as they came from
the press. There is nothing in the constitution
of a woman's mind nor in the anatomy
of her body to prevent her from following
the same studies that occupy the time and
attention of young men in an ordinary college
course. On the contrary, the duties of
the class-room are often far less fatiguing than
those of household labor.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> I believe in co-education.
Boys and girls should be brought
up together so far as possible. The influence
they exert over each other is in itself a
great civilizer. The separation of the sexes
in church, state, family and school has always
been productive of evil, and of evil only.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Miss Sophia Jex Blake, whose opinion
in all questions connected with the education
of women is of great weight, has thus expressed
herself touching the subject of co-education:
"That society is most happy
which conforms most strictly to the order of
nature as indicated in the family relation,
where brother and sister mutually elevate
and sustain each other.... A school for
young men becomes a community in itself,
with its own standard of morality and its laws
of honor; but in a college for both sexes
the student will find a public sentiment not
so lenient as that of a community of associates
needing the same indulgence."</p>

<p>Miss Blake elsewhere answers, it seems to
me with reason and justice, the oft-repeated
objection to co-education, founded upon the
imaginary danger of a too early romance and
a hasty attachment, followed by an unwise
and to-be-repented-of marriage:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is something in the association of
every-day life which appeals to the judgment
rather than to the fancy, and weeks and
months of steady labor over the same problems,
or at the same sciences, will not be
more likely to create romances than casual
meetings at fêtes and balls."</p>

<p>But I turn from the secular and civil aspect
of the subject to inquire what service
woman may render the church, and here I
am confronted by another question it would
be difficult to answer: What service has she
not rendered? Our churches, most of
them, will not ordain her to the ministry,
and yet do they not derive their spiritual life
from her influence? Could they exist without
her effort and faithful service? Who
preached the first Christian sermon, and proclaimed
to an unbelieving world, "He is risen
from the dead!" if not the women who ran
with great joy from the empty sepulcher,
bearing with them a license to preach from
the Christ himself, given through the Angel
of the Resurrection, who said, "Go quickly
and tell his disciples that he is risen from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the dead, and behold he goeth before
you into Galilee; there shall ye see him?"
That was a very short sermon and had
no text, but no pulpit rhetoric and no
Sunday oratory will ever eclipse its sublime
eloquence. If priests received their commission
to preach from the Apostles, the
Apostles received theirs from the women
who mourned at the sepulcher and found it
empty. Women can better afford to remain
out of the pulpit than the pulpit can afford
to exclude them. When the Christ shall return
and His kingdom be established forever,
the nations shall hear once more the
old Easter sermon first preached by a woman,
"He is risen from the dead!" The most
tender and faithful friendship our Saviour
ever found in his weary and painful pilgrimage
upon earth burned in the heart and
shone in the life of a noble and consecrated
woman.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">"Not she with trait'rous kiss her Master stung,</div>
    <div class="line">Not she denied him with unfaithful tongue;</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
And if the church was cradled in the arms
of Mary, have not the daughters of Mary
been singing to the child Jesus all along the
ages? It was Charlotte Elliott who wrote,
"Just as I am without one plea," and Mrs.
Adams who gave the church that immortal
hymn, "Nearer, my God, to Thee." "Fade,
fade, each earthly joy," "I need Thee every
hour," "Lord, I hear of showers of blessing,"
"I think when I read that sweet story
of old," "I love to tell the story," and
"How blest the righteous when he dies"—all
these were written by women. What
sweet singers chant cradle hymns to the child
Jesus—Felicia D. Hemans, Joanna Baillie,
Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Harriet Beecher
Stowe, Eliza Cook, Mrs. Baxter, Mrs. Codver,
Mrs. Bonar, Mrs. Barbauld and the
Cary sisters. If wise men came from the East
with gold, frankincense and myrrh for the
infant Redeemer, wise women are coming
every day from all parts of the earth with
gifts of heavenly song.</p>

<p>The success of every church depends in
large measure upon the consecration of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
women. I never knew a church in which there
were not more women than men; they constitute
the majority in every religious meeting;
and it would seem as if fifty women go to
heaven for every man who makes even a
moderate effort to get there. It was the service
of faithful and active women that saved
Israel in the hour of national peril. "When
the men of Israel," to employ the language
of another, "bowed in helplessness before
Pharaoh, two women spurned his edicts and
refused his behests. A father made no effort
to save the infant Moses, but a mother's care
hid him while concealment was possible, and
a sister watched over his preservation when
exposed on the river's brink. To woman
was intrusted the charge of providing for the
perils and wants of the wilderness; and in
the hour of triumph woman's voice was loudest
in the acclaim of joy that ascended to
heaven from an emancipated nation." The
same womanly courage, patience, love, tact
and wisdom must be the hope and strength
of modern Israel.</p>

<p>The men who have accomplished most owe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
much to woman's influence. From her counsel
the hero derived his courage, and in
her approving smile received his reward. The
great poems of the world are, many of them,
from her inspiration. Blanche of Lancaster
lives in the antique English of Chaucer, Laura
in the sonnets of Petrarch, and Beatrice in
the Divina Commedia of Dante; and who
can look upon the marbles of Michel Angelo
and not behold the influence of Vittoria
Colonna? In all literature there is not a
nobler sonnet addressed by man to woman
than this which Michel Angelo laid with
bowed heart and reverent hand at the feet of
Vittoria Colonna:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>John Stuart Mill, dedicating his immortal
"Essay on Liberty" to the memory of
his beloved wife whose earthly frame he
had laid to rest beneath the shades of beautiful
Avignon, described her as "the inspirer,
and in part the author, of all that was best
in his writings." The three "guardian angels"
whom Comte associated with his secret
thoughts, and whom he enshrined in his
innermost heart as the sacred judges of
his every wish and achievement, were his
mother Rosalie Boyer, his friend Clotilde de
Vaux, and his servant Sophie Bliot. Of
Madame de Vaux he wrote six years after her
death: "Adieu, my unchangeable companion!
Adieu, my holy Clotilde, who art to me at
once wife, sister, and daughter! Adieu, my
dear pupil, and my fit colleague. Thy celestial
inspiration will dominate the remainder
of my life, public as well as private, and preside
over my progress towards perfection,
purifying my sentiments, ennobling my
thoughts, and elevating my conduct. Perhaps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
as the principal reward of the grand
tasks yet left to me to complete under thy
powerful invocation, I shall inseparably write
thy name with my own, in the latest remembrances
of a grateful humanity." The Taj
Mahal which the poet Heber describes as "a
dream in marble, designed by Titans and finished
by jewellers," is a tribute of love raised
over the tomb of Moomtaza Mahul by her
husband, the great Mogul, Shah Jehan. She
died in giving birth to a daughter, and her
last request was that her husband would hallow
in his heart her love as the solitary and
immortal sanctity of his life. The Taj holds
directly under the centre dome, "gleaming
like a silver bubble at the edge of the sky,
almost as transparent in appearance as the
azure itself," the tombs of Shah Jehan and his
beloved wife. There the "married lovers"
rest, encased in jasper from Punjaub, turquoises
from Thibet, agate from Yeman, garnets
from Bundelkund, and onyx, amethyst
and lapis lazuli; and over them a single stone
is inscribed with the ninety-nine names of
God. To this day fresh flowers are placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
upon the marble sarcophagi, and above them
is to be seen the ostrich egg, symbol of the
all-encircling Divine Providence. "The
most exquisite building on the globe" is a
memorial of the love a noble and beautiful
woman inspired in the heart of a devoted
husband. Who shall measure the power and
authority of woman in the worlds of art, literature
and social life? And yet, great as is
her influence in these, it is even greater in
spiritual matters. Woman turns through a
natural instinct to the field of religious usefulness,
and Renan is not mistaken when he
tells us that she has a special tendency to
"long after the infinite." Of this Frances
Power Cobbe gives us a forcible illustration
in a foot-note to her able essay on "The Fitness
of Women for the Ministry of Religion."
The illustration is taken from Mrs.
Kemble's autobiography, and runs as follows:
"She describes the late Lady Byron
as often expressing envy of her (Mrs. Kemble's)
public readings, and her longing to have
similar crowds in sympathy with her own impressions.
'I made her laugh,' says Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Kemble, 'by telling her that more than once
when looking from my reading-desk over the
sea of faces uplifted toward me, a sudden
feeling had seized me that I must say something
<i>from myself</i> to all these human beings
whose attention I felt at that moment entirely
at my command, and between whom and
myself a sense of sympathy thrilled powerfully
and strangely through my heart as I
looked steadfastly at them before opening my
lips; but that on wondering afterwards what
I might, could, would or should have said to
them from myself, I never could think of
anything but two words—'<i>Be good!</i>'" Miss
Cobbe writes: "I believe that nine women
out of ten of the better sort would, if they had
the choice, oftener speak of duty and religion
than of any other theme." Is not Goëthe
right?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">"The eternal womanly</div>
    <div class="line">Draws us upward and onward."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Great is the power of consecrated womanhood
in domestic life. It has been shown by
able writers that boys who have sisters, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
grow up in their society, are more likely to
develop into strong and noble men than boys
who are deprived of woman's influence.
Whatever separates man from woman separates
both from God. The great objection
urged against social clubs is that they destroy
domestic life by isolating the sexes; they furnish
an amusement for the husband in which
the wife cannot participate. Open the social
club to both sexes, and its evil tendency is
removed.</p>

<p>Then there is the marriage relation. How
many wedded lives come to failure through
ignorance. Men and women assume the
most sacred responsibilities without preparation,
and with no knowledge of themselves
nor of each other. We say in the marriage
service, "What God hath joined together let
not man put asunder;" but when God does
not join, is there anything to sunder? Passion
dies, novelty disappears, youth fades, and
unless love be founded upon an intelligent
and mutual esteem, shall it not also crumble?
It has been said, "one cannot be at once
lover and friend," but you may be sure one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
will not long remain the former who is not as
well the latter. We need to cultivate friendship.
Passion will come and go like the
shadows of clouds over the smooth surface
of a lake, and no love is abiding without
friendship. He was right who exclaimed,
"They who are joined by love without
friendship, walk on gunpowder with lighted
torches in their hands!" They who build
love upon the foundation of mutual esteem—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">"Make life, death, and that vast forever</div>
    <div class="line">One grand, sweet song."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>How shall we strengthen love that it may
endure when the fires of youth and passion
are cold? Only by the cultivation of those
noble virtues which like bands of steel weld
together in one life and faith honest and
pure hearts. How shall two hearts grow old
together? Only by the persistent cultivation
of those qualities which are ever young
and which age not with declining years.
The young man will not be guilty of an act
tainted with meanness or baseness lest the
maiden he loves blot his image from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
pure heaven of her heart; let the young
husband and wife cherish the same fear and
honor, and they shall grow nearer and dearer
as the years silver their brows. The happiness
of marriage depends upon the very
highest and most delicate of reserves, the
most noble and careful speech, the best and
most honorable perception; upon a kindness
greater than that of a mother to her child.</p>

<p>The supreme glory of consecrated womanhood
lies in the consecration itself. The love
of God makes every other love immortal.
What love through Him we give to others is
forever. Only as we consecrate our lives to
the Divine Love can we hope to become
heavenly-minded; and they only consecrate
themselves to the Divine Love who, in imitation
of our Saviour, give heart and hand to
the service of mankind. There is a fable
that four young ladies, disputing as to the
beauty of their hands, called upon an aged
woman who had solicited alms, for a settlement
of the dispute. The three whose hands
were white and faultless had refused her appeal,
while she whose fingers were brown and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
rough had given in charity. Then the aged
beggar said: "Beautiful are these six uplifted
hands, soft as velvet and snowy as the lily:
but more beautiful are the two darker hands
that have given charity to the poor." Learn
the lesson of consecrated womanhood. In
olden times, when the children of Israel
prepared the Tabernacle in the wilderness,
"all the women that were wise-hearted did
spin with their hands, and brought that which
they had spun, both of blue, and of purple,
and of scarlet, and of fine linen. And all
the women whose heart stirred them up in
wisdom spun goats' hair." The wise-hearted
women of to-day are the daughters of modern
Israel who from the love of God serve faithfully
the great family of mankind.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A" id="Footnote_A"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> It may be a matter of interest to some who read this sermon
to know who was the first woman to graduate from an
American college. In an article on "The First Female
College" (the Georgia Female College), in the "Century"
for May, 1890, Mr. H. S. Edwards states that he has been
unable to obtain the name of any woman who graduated at
Oberlin in 1838. An Oberlin College catalogue, however,
gives the name of Miss Zeruiah Porter (afterwards Mrs.
Tweed) as the graduate of 1838, and therefore the first graduate
of an American college. Miss Porter graduated in the
so-called literary course, which did not include Greek. In
1841, Miss Mary Hosford, Miss Elizabeth S. Prall, and Miss
Mary C. Rudd took the degree of A. B. at Oberlin.</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
